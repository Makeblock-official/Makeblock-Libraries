# Makeblock Library v3.24

Arduino Library for Makeblock Electronic Modules

### How to use:

1. Download the source from the git https://github.com/Makeblock-official/Makeblock-Libraries

2. In the Arduino IDE: "Sketch-> Include Library-> Add .ZIP Library-> select the downloaded file-> Open"

3. Click "File-> Examples". Here are some test programs in "MakeBlockDrive->"

4. Depending on the type of board you're using, you need to modify the header file to match.
   For example, if you're using a mCore. You should change `#include <MeOrion.h>` to `#include <MeMCore.h>`
   Corresponding boards and there header file are:

   Orion <-------->  MeOrion.h

   BaseBoard <---->  MeBaseBoard.h

   mCore <-------->  MeMCore.h

   Shield <------->  MeShield.h

   Auriga <------->  MeAuriga.h

   MegaPi <------->  MeMegaPi.h
